# CaptureTheBlock

Capture The Block (CTB) is a Minecraft minigame implemented through a Spigot plugin.

In this game, players are required to find and stand on a given block within the time limit. If everyone on your team stands on the block before the time limit, your team gets the point. Once all teams have found their blocks, all teams are given new blocks. Admins can select different lists of blocks to select from so that early game teams can be assigned easy blocks, and later teams can be assigned harder blocks. Games can be stoppped and restarted across multiple playsessions.
